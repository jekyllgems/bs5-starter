# Bootstrap v5.3 Starter Jekyll Template

This is the Jekyll implementation of the Bootstrap v5.3 starter template. It is not meant to be a robust website, it is only meant to be a starter template to help you get off and running. It is not designed like the normal template in that it has "posts" a "blog" etc. It is a one page html file. It is designed to be this way so those who are new to jekyll can download it and get started making their own templates. I will add more color themes in time to this repo so you can switch them out. I prefer dark themes. Currently this is not a gem and can not be installed that way, I may change that in time.
